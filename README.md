# The-Rajputana-Oddsey
The Rajputana Odyssey is a small single-page site built with React, TypeScript and Vite that showcases destinations, travel packages and sample trip plans for Rajasthan. It uses lazy-loaded routes, modular components, image galleries and sample data files so you can quickly preview, customize or integrate it into another project.
